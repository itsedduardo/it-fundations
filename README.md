Hi! I'm Edu, an IT student focusing on building strong foundations in:

- Java 
- SQL 
- Linux 
- Computer Networks 

This repository is a **learning log** where I document:
- Practice exercises
- Notes and summaries
- Small experiments and labs
- Progress over time

The goal is consistency and learning by doing.
Feel free to explore!
